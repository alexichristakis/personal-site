      The problem I am the most passionate and enthusiastic about solving is
      accessible, affordable, and reliable healthcare. I believe health is a
      human right, and that tech has the ability to democratize it. As with all
      industries that rely on outdated systems, simple yet well designed
      products can add enormous benefit to care-managers, physicians, and
      patients. It’s exciting to see ambitious startups tackle the problem from
      numerous aspects, and I would love to contribute to their success. At
      TrialSpark, I saw through the lens of the clinical trial, where their
      products both streamline the processes of pharmaceutical companies, and
      allow physicians to access previously underserved populations. I look
      forward to applying my experiences to future opportunities at other
      organizations.

      In May of 2020 I will graduate from Yale University with a B.S. degree in
      Computer Science. Outside of the major, I’ve taken graphic design courses
      to focus on critical analysis of user interfaces, and to enhance my
      proficiency in making informational hierarchies.

      Last year I founded Sandbox, a club at Yale which equips students with the
      technical toolkit necessary to turn ideas into products. My co-founders
      and I became frustrated with the theoretical focus of the Computer Science
      curricula. We designed and developed an applied program as a complement.
      Each semester we look for bright students interested in learning modern
      web frameworks and design thinking. We’re sponsored by Google, which
      empowers us to host their Product Mangers for design and product audits of
      student work, and Yale alumni who have become technical co-founders.
      Professionally, I’ve worked as a software engineering intern for two
      Summers. My most recent experience was at TrialSpark—a Sequoia-backed
      startup reinventing the clinical trial process to bring new treatments to
      patients faster. There I had the opportunity to own a feature called
      “Print Source,” which allows clinical research coordinators and physicians
      to quickly export patient data into tabulated PDFs for archival and parity
      in clinical EMR systems. With complete autonomy of the design and
      development of Print Source, I expanded my technical and leadership
      abilities throughout my internship.

      As part of an early-stage startup, I was a valued member of the team, able
      to collaborate with product managers and designers, and focus on honing in
      on my technical skills. This experience amplified my passion for health
      care and startups, and helped me realize my own interest in pursuing
      product as a career.
